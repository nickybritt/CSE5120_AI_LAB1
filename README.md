# CSE5120 Intro to AI Lab 1
This lab is done to gain an understanding of search algorithm, and we used breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), uniform cost search (UCS), and A-star search(A*).

# How to compile
Add test cases which mean to add a `input.txt` with a START STATE and GOAL STATE and `output.txt` location of the results.

Compile with `g++ -o LAB1 search.cpp` (using g++ version version 1.26.3) and then run with `./LAB1`.
